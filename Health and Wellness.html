  <p><strong>How does a player take care of themselves in between matches?</strong> Drink water after every match because it will help with focusing on your next match and staying hydrated.<br>
	  <strong> What should be included in a healthy routine to prevent injury and maintain good health for gamers?</strong> sunlight because no gamer will get enough sunlight.<br>
	  <strong> What healthy habits should gamers use to be at peak performance?</strong> touch grass, say no more.</p>
	<h1>Exercise</h1>
	<h3>What are the ideal exercise plans? How often should you do each one?</h3>
	<p>For gamers and people who want to get started to working out, Walking is a starter and the easiest to do. You should walk for 30-60 minutes each day. 2 days after you started walking, do 20 squats and 20 lunges, then 10 push-ups. increase the numbers later on. This should help keep your balance of gaming and physical exercises stable.</p>
	<h1>Eating Healthy</h1>
	<h3>What are the ideal diets? How strictly do you have to be?</h3>
	<p>The Ideal diet that I want is a balanced meal of meat or fish, fruits, vegetables, and dairy. How strict you have to be is not really that strict because this is for a gamer's diet, not for bodybuilders.</p>
	<h1>Coaching Healthy</h1>
	<h3>What is the basic weekly plan that they should follow?</h3>
	<p>make a food and activity log like mine below, this will help keep track of what you eat and do for you to change and understand what you are eating daily.</p>
