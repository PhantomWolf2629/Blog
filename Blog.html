<p> <strong> What Makes video games so enticing and entertaining?&nbsp;</strong></p>
<p>What I think of how video games are enticing and entertaining is because of how thrilling and exciting it is to watch or play. It catches the attention of so many people from kids to adults or even elders. Videos games are for entertaining people not to make it real and let us keep it that way.</p>
<p><strong>What makes video games good for you?&nbsp;</strong></p>
	
<p>&nbsp;“Studies have shown that some video games can boost mood and make for better heart rhythms—a sign that they may also help relieve stress” (GEICO.com).
  Another thing is that they trick your kids into learning new things like Minecraft. It requires them to have scenes of survival, problem-solving, and dexterity to beat the game. These are just a few reasons why video games are good for you and can make a difference in your life.</p>
<p><strong>What is my gaming experience?/What game will you choose for your coaching project? Why that game?
&nbsp;</strong></p>
	
<p>The silent room with doors closed, dark like the night sky, and a single chair faced to the T.V. this is a small description of the setting to my gaming experience. The game I would choose is For Honor. Because it's a competitive and hard game to learn. this would be a perfect game for me since I play it a lot and know all the controls.</p>
	
<p><strong>How does Social Media make you feel?</strong></p>
	<p>It does make me feel relaxed and bored sometimes because it can be soothing and peace-minded from reality, but it can also be boring if nothing interests you. it also makes me feel distant from my family because of how addicting it is to look at it 24/7.  What conclusions can you draw from these statistics? I can make up for all of that the statistics are pretty accurate to discover what social media is doing to us. What are the key takeaways from the video? that if you are dis-active it leads to depression this is similar to my experience of when I was dis-active on social media it was depressing.</p>

<p><strong>What does it take to be a good coach for esports? What do you think you are good at and what do you think you need to work on? </strong> A good coach for esports has the will to lead and understand the sports through the experience of that sport. They should be able to know all the rules and give a detailed example of moves that can and should be used in that sport. another example of a good coach is being a good communicator to explain, teacher to teach them the moves, and a listener to understand your players.
what I think I'm good at is listening and understanding the sport through experience but what I need to work on is being a good teacher and communicator to help with being a good coach. </p>

	<p><strong>When you play a game in your usual area do you sit, stand, lay down, etc.? What sort of gamer snacks and drinks do you consume while playing? How long is a typical session of gaming? </strong>In the past, I would stand up and jump around the room when I was gaming because of how energetic I was. Now I sit right in front of the screen. for snacks and drinks, I would eat chips and water. How long a typical session of gaming is about 1-5 hours long.
